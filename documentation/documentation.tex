    \section{Introduction}

        \subsection{Context}
            The goal of this project is to monitor a given area using a 
            webcam. The system designed here should detect any kinds 
            of movement and notify the users. The footage of the webcam
            is streamed over a network and multiple users can connect to
            it. They also have the possibility to sign-up for email
            alerts regarding any issues.

        \subsection{Specifications}
            This system can be used on a local network, where the "server" 
            is responsible for the movement detection and video streaming
            and multiple clients can connect to it.

        \subsection{Objectives}
            Design and implement a way of detecting movement on a video
            feed, stream it and and notify the users.
